## PokemonTopTrumps
Pokémon-based Top Trumps game

This program is an extended version of a Pokémon-based Top Trumps game.
Players are given the choice to select a Pokémon from multiple random options.
The game supports multiple rounds, and the player with the most rounds won is declared the winner.
In each round, both the player and the computer (opponent) choose a stat (ID, height, weight, or base_experience) to compare.
The Pokémon with the higher chosen stat wins the round.
If both Pokémon have the same chosen stat, the round is considered a draw.
